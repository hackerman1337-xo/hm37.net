My name is Thomas, but you can call me Tom. I'm a father, husband, gamer, and [Twitch Streamer](https://twitch.tv/NeonTom). As is typical of those in my profession, I have something of a caffeine addiction. As such, you'll find me rambling about my favorite coffees on here. I'm working on re-branding my discord and gaming platforms currently.

My blog name comes from my PSN account, `hackerman1337-xo`, which is a humorous take on my line of work.
